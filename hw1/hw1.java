/* 
Immediately after looking at the Java code, the Java code is more verbose. In
Python or Scheme, the amount of effort put into typing is significantly less.
Java, Python, and Scheme all have certain keywords that begin a function. 
For example, Python has "def" and Scheme has "Lambda." In addition, all the languages use 
quotation marks to denote a string and take in arguments. Java also has brackets, like Scheme.
However, Java requires more. Syntax such as "public" or "class" are required. Lastly, 
when calling a built in function in Python or Scheme, it is usually just the name
of the function. Java requires a "System.out" in front of the function name and a 
semi-colon after calling the function.
