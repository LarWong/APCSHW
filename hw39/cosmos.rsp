Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"

After Neil deGrasse Tyson explores our cosmic address, I feel really insignificant. While it was intreesting exploring the Earth's location in the Solar System to the observable universe, the while process made me admire astronomers even more. They have gone so far in understanding the monstrocity that we live in. Also, there is nothing more lonely than realizing that we are basically floating in the middle of nowhere in a galaxy in the middle of nowhere.

On a side note, props to Bruno for sticking to what he believed in. I would never have the courage to sacrafice everything to talk about such controversial thing.

I still find it unbelievable that human have only existed for a few seconds of the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the last week of the last month of the cosmic calendar.
How were the producers/scientists able to map such a thing on a calendar with such accuracy?

Human pattern recognition is more amazing that I thought. I understood that pattern recognition was useful to human survival, but I never knew that it was such a neccessary tool for humans, even if it led to troubles in certain occasions. Now it makes more sense why three dots in a specific orientation looks like a human face.

Why were Hooke and Newton such difficuly people back then? Hooke had already accomplished many feat and he still wanted more? Also, why was Newton so hurt by that? Today, people accuse each other of many things and people are always ready to refute claims.

Listening to stroies of Halley really inspires me, especcially about the part where he traveled to many places to obtain recordings of commets. Also, Halley waiting 12 months just so the weather clears to draw a star map amazes me. This just motivates me to do so  much more with my life.
